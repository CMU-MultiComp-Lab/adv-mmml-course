    Week 2: <strong>Cross-modal interactions</strong> <a href="11877_week2.pdf">[synopsis]</a>
  topics:
    - What are the different ways in which modalities can interact with each other in multimodal tasks? Can we formalize a taxonomy of such cross-modal interactions, which will enable us to compare and contrast them more precisely? <br/>
    - What are the design decisions (aka inductive biases) that can be used when modeling these cross-modal interactions in machine learning models? <br/>
    - What are the advantages and drawbacks of designing models to capture each type of cross-modal interaction? Consider not just prediction performance, but tradeoffs in time/space complexity, interpretability, etc. <br/>
    - Given an arbitrary dataset and prediction task, how can we systematically decide what type of cross-modal interactions exist, and how can that inform our modeling decisions? <br/>
    - Given trained multimodal models, how can we understand or visualize the nature of cross-modal interactions? <br/>

  topics:
    - What are the types of cross-modal interactions involved to enable such co-learning scenarios where multimodal training ends up generalizing to unimodal testing? <br/>
    - What are some design decisions (inductive bias) that could be made to promote transfer of information from one modality to another? <br/>
    - How do we ensure that during co-learning, only useful information is transferred, and not some undesirable bias? This may become a bigger issue in low-resource settings. <br/>
    - How can we know if co-learning has succeeded? Or failed? What approaches could we develop to visualize and probe the success of co-learning? <br/>
    - How can we formally, empirically, or intuitively measure the additional information provided by auxiliary modality? How can we design controlled experiments to test these hypotheses? <br/>
    - What are the advantages and drawbacks of information transfer during co-learning? Consider not just prediction performance, but also tradeoffs with complexity, interpretability, fairness, etc. <br/>

    - What are certain methods of parametrizing memory in unimodal models that may be applied for multimodal settings, and the various strengths/weaknesses of each approach? <br/>
    - How should we model long-term cross-modal interactions? How can we design models (perhaps with memory mechanisms) to ensure that these long-term cross-modal interactions are captured? <br/>
    - What are the main advantages of explicitly building memory-based modules into our architectures, as compared to the large-scale pre-training methods/Transformer models discussed in week 4? Do Transformer models already capture memory and long-term interactions implicitly? <br/>

    - When reflecting on the heterogeneous aspect of multimodal learning, how are the other modalities different from language, speech, and vision? What dimensions of heterogeneity are important for these other modalities? <br/>
    - What are the cross-modal interactions that you expect in these other modalities? Could you see ways to model cross-modal interactions with these other modalities and with language and vision? <br/>
    - How do the core research problems of unimodal and multimodal processing, integration, alignment, translation, and co-learning generalize to modalities beyond language and vision? What core insights from these ‘common’ modalities have yet to be explored in understudied modalities? <br/>
    - What is the best way to visualize these relatively understudied modalities? How can we best analyze and characterize the multimodal interactions present between these other modalities? <br/>

  topics:
    - What could be a taxonomy of biases in multimodal datasets and models? <br/>
    - What are some risks related to biases (e.g., social biases) when creating new datasets? How are these risks potentially amplified or reduced when the dataset is multimodal, with heterogeneous modalities? Are there any biases that are specific to multimodal data? <br/>
    - What are the imperfections that may arise during human annotations? How do these imperfections in data and labels affect multimodal learning of multimodal representations, cross-modal interactions, co-learning, and pre-training? <br/>
    - Can biases also emerge not only from the multimodal training data, but also from the modeling design decisions themselves? What aspects of multimodal modeling are most prone to learning and possibly emphasizing biases? <br/>
    - What are potential solutions for tackling these risks and biases in multimodal datasets and models? How can we properly identify, visualize and eventually reduce these biases in multimodal datasets and models? <br/>
    - How can we better interpret multimodal datasets and models to check for potential biases? What specific dimensions should we strive to understand? <br/>
    - What are the tradeoffs between large-scale, noisily-collected and annotated multimodal datasets versus small-scale, carefully-curated and annotated datasets? How do these affect multimodal modeling? How does it relate to the popular pre-training paradigm? <br/>
