    Week 2: <strong>Dimensions of heterogeneity</strong> <a href="11877_week2.pdf">[synopsis]</a>
  topics:
    - What is a taxonomy of the dimensions in which modalities can be heterogeneous?
    - Heterogeneity is also often seen in several other ML subfields (e.g., domain adaptation, domain shift, transfer learning, multitask learning, federated learning, etc). What are some similarities and differences between the notions of heterogeneity between MMML and these fields? Can definitions or methods in each area be adapted to benefit other research areas?
    - How can we formalize these dimensions of heterogeneity, and subsequently estimate these measures to quantify the degree in which modalities are different?
    - Modality heterogeneity often implies the design of specialized models capturing the unique properties of each modality. What are some tradeoffs in modality-specific vs modality-general models?
    - What are other modeling considerations that ideally should be informed based on how heterogeneous the input modalities are?
    - What are some risks if we were to ignore modality or task heterogeneity? What if we are unable to estimate modality or task heterogeneity accurately?

    Week 3: <strong>Modality connections</strong> <a href="11877_week3.pdf">[synopsis]</a>
  topics:
    - What are the reasons why modalities can be connected with each other? Come up with a taxonomy of various dimensions. Think along both statistical, data-driven dimensions and semantic, hypothesis or knowledge driven dimensions. What are the pros and cons of either approach in understanding modality connections?
    - Are connections always strong and one-to-one? Reflect on what could make some cross-modal connections stronger or weaker, including many-to-many connections, ambiguity or noises?
    - Given trained multimodal models, how can we understand or visualize the nature of connections captured by the model?
    - What formalism or framework could be used to formalize cross-modal connections? How can we subsequently define estimators, where we can accurately quantify the presence of each type of connection given a dataset? How much knowledge of each modality do we need in order to estimate modality connections?
    - Linking back to week 1’s discussion on heterogeneity, how would you relate the concepts of heterogeneity and connections? How is heterogeneity affecting the study of crossmodal connections and inversely, how connections should be taken into consideration when heterogeneity is studied? Are connections also present in homogenous settings?

    Week 4: <strong>Modality interactions</strong>
  topics:
    - What are the different ways in which modalities can interact with each other when used for a prediction tasks? Think across both semantic and statistical perspectives. Can we formalize a taxonomy of such interactions, which will enable us to compare and contrast them more precisely? In fact, should we even try creating such a taxonomy?
    - Can you think of ways modalities could interact with each others, even if there is no prediction task? How are modalities interacting during cross-modal translation? During multimodal generation?
    - Linking back to last week’s discussion, are there cases where modalities are connected but do not interact? Or interact but are not connected? Can we design formal experiments to test either hypotheses?
    - What mathematical or empirical frameworks can be used to formalize the meaning of interactions? How can we subsequently define estimators, where we can accurately quantify the presence of each type of interactions given a dataset?
    - Some definitions (from the semantic category) typically require human interactions to detect and quantify interactions. What are some opportunities and limitations of using human judgment to analyze interactions? Can we potentially design estimators to automate the human labeling process?
    - What are the design decisions (aka inductive biases) that can be used when modeling each type of interaction in machine learning models?
    - What are the advantages and drawbacks of designing models to capture each type of cross-modal interaction? Consider not just prediction performance, but tradeoffs in time/space complexity, interpretability, etc.

    Week 5: <strong>Modality utility, tradeoffs, and selection</strong>
  topics:
    - What are the different ways in which modalities can be useful for a task? How can we measure the utility of a modality for a task, given only access to the dataset (i.e., before designing and training a model)?
    - What are the criterion for which we should add or select modalities for a task? Is minimizing redundancy the only goal? Are there benefits in maximizing redundancy? Are there other criterion we should consider too?
    - Is modality selection the same as feature selection? What are the potential differences and new technical challenges in modality selection but not present in conventional feature selection? 
    - Given trained models, how can we estimate how important each modality was when making the prediction? How were these modalities used separately and in interaction with other modalities?
    - What are the different ways in which modalities can be harmful for a task? Think about a list of reasons why we would prefer to not use a modality. How can we quantify these potential risks?
    - What are some solutions for tackling these risks and biases in multimodal datasets and models? How can we properly identify, visualize and eventually reduce these risks in multimodal datasets and models?
    - Can we come up with guidelines that compare the tradeoffs between modality benefits and risks? How can we then integrate these insights into multimodal model design? Will integrating these insights help?

    Week 6: <strong>Pretraining and scaling</strong>
  topics:
    - Is large-scale pretraining the way forward for building general AI models? What information potentially cannot be captured by pretraining? What are some potential risks of pretraining and scenarios where we should not use pretrained models?
    - How can we, in an academic environment, do impactful research in multimodal pretraining? What would be your proposed multi-year research agenda in this topic?
    - What are the types of cross-modal interactions that are likely to be modeled by current pretrained models? What cross-modal interactions will be harder to model with these methods? Do you have proposals for different pretraining data, architectures, or objectives that can better capture these interactions?
    - How can we best integrate multimodality into pretrained language models? What kind of additional data and modeling/optimization decisions do we need?
    - What are the different design decisions when integrating multimodal information in pretraining models and objectives? What are the main advantages and drawbacks of these design choices? Consider not just prediction performance, but tradeoffs in time/space complexity, interpretability, and so on.
    - How can we evaluate the type of multimodal information learned in pretrained models? One approach is to look at downstream tasks, but what are other ways to uncover the knowledge stored in pretrained models?
